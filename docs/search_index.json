Since \\(MRS\\) clearly decreases as \\(x\\) increases, the indifference curves are convex. \\(U(x,y) = \\sqrt{x} + y\\) then \\(y = U_1 - \\sqrt{x}\\) and the \\(MRS = -(-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}\\). Clearly this \\(MRS\\) decreases with \\(x\\) so yes these indifference curves are convex. \\(U(x,y) = \\sqrt{x^2 - y^2}\\) Then, \\[\\begin{align*} U_1 &amp; = \\sqrt{x^2 - y^2}\\\\ U^2_1 &amp; = x^2 - y^2 \\\\ y^2 &amp; = x^2 - U^2_1 \\\\ y &amp; = \\sqrt{x^2 - U^2_1} \\end{align*}\\] And then finding the \\(MRS\\), \\[\\begin{align*} MRS &amp; = -( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2(x^2 - U^2_1)}}2x) \\end{align*}\\] Yes, these indifference curves decrease as x increases, but this is a tricky question because this is not a proper utility curve to begin with. To check out these and other indifference curves see desmos.com/calculator a-d indifference curves 3.3 \\(U(x,y) = xy\\) From above, \\(MRS = \\frac{U_1}{x^2}\\) and we verified it was decreasing MRS. Marginal Utilities: \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = y\\] which is constant with respect to \\(x\\). \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = x\\] which is constant with respect to \\(y\\). \\(U(x,y) = x^2y^2\\) Similarly, \\(MRS = \\frac{\\sqrt{U_1}}{x^2}\\), which we showed was decreasing. Marginal Utilities: \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = 2xy^2\\] which is increasing in x. \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = 2x^2y\\] which is increasing with respect to \\(y\\). \\(U(x,y) = ln(x) + ln(y)\\) Show that \\(y = \\frac{e^{U_1}}{x}\\) is the equation for a general indifference curve and \\(MRS = \\frac{e^{U_1}}{x^2}\\), and show that it is decreasing. Marginal Utilities: \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{x}\\] and \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{y}\\] both marginal utilities are increasing. What can we conclude from this?? We can conclude that decreasing marginal utility is not neccessary to get diminishing \\(MRS\\) and quasiconcavity. The book makes a bid deal out of this, because, in the U.S. it is common to teach the intuition for decreasing \\(MRS\\) by starting with decreasing marginal utility. And it makes a very good intuitive explanation of how utility math functions can be related to actual human behavior, but mathematically, it is not technically required to have decreasing marginal utility to get decreasing \\(MRS\\). 3.5 perfect compliments 1 hotdog perfectly fixed with condiments \\(1 + 0.25 + 0.05 + 0.30 = \\$1.60\\) \\(cost = \\$2.10\\) a percent increase of \\(31\\%\\) \\(cost = \\$1.725\\) lower percent increase (\\(7.8\\%\\)) because the bun is a smaller component of the overall cost. Spread the tax so there is no waste of utility. A hotdog with all the condiments only needs to cost \\(\\$2.60\\) a \\(62.5\\%\\) increase. Thus increase the cost of each component by \\(62.5\\%\\). \\[1.625(1*\\$1 + 0.5*\\$0.50 + 1*\\$0.05 + 2*\\$0.15) = \\$2.60\\] 3.7 At point \\((6,5)\\) the \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{3}\\) and at point \\((12,3)\\) the \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{3}\\) This can only happen with a linear indifference curve. Find the equation by finding the line through the two points. Using the point-slope form of a line from algebra, we find the indifference curve through \\((6,5)\\) can be expressed as: \\[7 = y + \\frac{1}{3}x\\] Then, 7 takes the place of our utility level we usually call \\(U_1\\), and we can write the general utility function as: \\[U(x,y) = y + \\frac{1}{3}x\\] The problem description implies that \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{4}\\). Further, we know the \\(MRS\\) of a Cobb-Douglass utility function is given by: \\[MRS = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\frac{y}{x}\\] Then, by plugging in the \\(MRS\\) value and the point, we can recover \\(\\alpha\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{4} &amp; = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\alpha &amp; = (1-\\alpha)2 \\\\ \\alpha &amp; = \\frac{2}{3} \\\\ 1-\\alpha &amp; = \\frac{1}{3} \\end{align*}\\] and so now we know the full utiilty function. 3.10 Does not depend on \\(\\alpha + \\beta = 1\\). To see this, suppose \\(\\alpha + \\beta \\neq 1\\). Then since preferences are indifferent to a monotonic transformation, sustitute \\(\\alpha = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}\\) now \\(\\alpha + \\beta = 1\\) (go ahead and check it!). "]
