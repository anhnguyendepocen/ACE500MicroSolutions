Do not consult these solutions until after you have spend hours toiling and thinking about the problems. If you do not heed this warning the exams will be painful. Report an Error or Typo If you find a typo or mistake, please report it to me by email. If you are a Github user, submit an ‘issue’. Better yet, download the markdown text file from the github repository and fix and send back to me! Also, you can go to the github repository and find the raw .RMD files that build the solution webpage. Looking at these files side by side will be helpful as you are trying to figure out Latex Math commands for the first time. This Latex Wiki is another good resource for getting started. Feel free to ask me for help in this. The learning curve can be a little steep, and a simple mistake can cost a beginner a lot of unnecessary time. "],
["homework-solutions-assignment.html", "Homework Solutions Assignment", " Homework Solutions Assignment Currently, the solutions to our problem sets are handwritten by me, scanned to digital copies, and available to you on compass. The quality of these documents has been poor for a long time, and I have been meaning to type them up for years, but I cannot seem to find the time. Previous classes have suggested students could type up the solutions for extra credit. I have come to think this is a good idea. Your Responsibility I do not want you to spend a ton of time on this project; you will be busy enough with classes, exams, and regular homework. But, learning how to type up scientific documents is good training in and of itself. You must sign up for and type one homework solution. This assignment is worth 10% of your final grade. Formatting the Document For credit, you are required to type the documents in Markdown. This is a simple alternative to Latex, which has a pretty steep learning curve. What makes Markdown nice is that you can use latex if you want to, and math equations can be written in latex code and rendered by markdown. Just search ‘Latex Math’ and there are many cheat-sheets and lists of symbols. For example, $$E=MC^2$$ or $$C=\\pi R^2$$ Becomes \\[E=MC^2\\] or \\[C=\\pi R^2\\] Figures Many of our problem sets will involve drawing figures. Please hand-draw the figures neatly with pen and paper. When you submit you will turn in a markdown document in .txt file format, a rendered .html , and any figure in format .jpg, .png. Simply take a photo of your hand drawn figure. Pictures can be included in markdown like this… ![Caption](‘filepath-to-figure/figure1.jpg’) I’ll take care of code for figures when I put it up on the web. Instead of this, simply write something like… (figure 1 here) Directly in the markdown text. Where to Typeset the Markdown Documents? This website, https://stackedit.io/editor, is a free online Markdown editor. You just type on one left side, and you see the typeset version on the right. There is an ‘Export as’ button that allows you to export as .html. When you turn these in, please include the Markdown code in a .txt file, and a .html of the formatted document as well. Assignment Due Date Please go to the Homework Solution Assignment Wiki to sign up for which chapter you would like to type up. You are to turn in your documents to me via email by the day the chapter is scheduled on our syllabus. Sign-ups are first come first served. Thinking Ahead I have been interested in Reproducible Research for some time. You can write research papers in Markdown, with you statistical analysis woven directly into to the document so that your raw data gets processed to clean data, to analysis, to populating your paper with results, with a click of one button. That greatly reduces the likelihood of errors, and ensures that your future self will be able to go back and reproduce, or tweak your analysis without forgetting a bunch of steps in between. If you think this is a good idea, check out a template I wrote this template to help students get started writing papers in RMarkdown, and integrating statistical analysis directly into papers with R, RStudio, and RMarkdown.

["chapter-2-solutions.html", "Chapter 2 Solutions", " Chapter 2 Solutions Suppose \\(U(x,y)=4x^2+3y^2\\) Calculate \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\), and \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\) \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}=8x\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}=6y\\) Evaluate these partial derivatives ad \\(x=1\\) and \\(y=2\\) \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}\\vert_{(1,2)}=8\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\vert_{(1,2)}=12\\) Write the total differential for \\(U\\). \\(dU=\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x}*dx + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}*dy\\) \\(dU=8x*dx + 6y*dy\\) Calculate \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) for \\(dU=0\\); that is, what is the implied trade-off between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) holding \\(U\\) constant. \\(0=8xdx + 6ydy\\) \\(-8xdx = 6ydy\\) \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{dy}{dx}\\) A note about Markdown and Latex. If you want to align the equations at the equal sign, you need a bit more straight Latex. $$ \\begin{align} 0 &amp; = 8xdx + 6ydy -8xdx &amp; = 6ydy -\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{x}{y} &amp; = \\frac{dy}{dx} \\end{align} $$ \\[\\begin{align} 0 &amp; = 8xdx + 6ydy \\\\ -8xdx &amp; = 6ydy \\\\ -\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{x}{y} &amp; = \\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\ \\end{align}\\] Show \\(U=16\\) when \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\). \\(U(1,2) = 4*1^2 + 3*2^2 = 4 + 12 = 16\\) In what ratio must \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) change to hold \\(U\\) constant at 16 for movements away from \\(x=1\\). \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=-\\frac{4}{3}*\\frac{1}{2} = - \\frac{2}{3}\\) More generally, what is the slope of the \\(U=16\\) contour line for this function? What is the slope of that line? Contour line is an ellipse. \\(16 = 4x^2 + 3y^2 \\Rightarrow y = \\pm \\frac{2}{\\sqrt 3}\\sqrt{4-x^2}\\) Slope \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(4-x^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}(-2x)\\) 2.2 Suppose a firm’s total revenues depend on the amount produced \\((q)\\) according to the function \\[R = 70q - q^2\\] Total costs also depend on \\(q\\): \\[C=q^2 + 30q + 100\\] What level of output should the firm produce in order to maximize profits \\((R-C)\\)? What will profits be? \\[\\pi = 70q - q^2-30q^2-100\\] Need to maximize profit with respect to \\(q\\). \\[\\frac{d\\pi}{dq} = 70 - 4q - 30 = 40 - q\\] Set first order condition equal to 0. \\[40 - 4q = 0\\] \\[\\frac{40}{4} = q\\] \\[10 = q\\] Profit at \\(\\pi\\) max \\[\\pi\\vert_{q=10} = 700 - 100 - 100 - 300 - 100\\] Show that the second-order conditions for a maximum are satisfied at the output level found in part (a)? \\[\\frac{d^2\\pi}{dq^2} = -4 &lt; 0 \\] Second derivative is negative, so the function is concave, and therefore local optimum is a maximum. Does the solution calculated here obey the “marginal revenue equals marginal cost” rule? Yes. \\(MR = 70 - 2q\\) and \\(MC = 2q + 30\\). \\[MR = MC \\Rightarrow 70 - 2q = 2q + 30 \\Rightarrow 40 - 4q = 0\\] Which is the first order condition we solved to get our solution. 2.3 Suppose that \\(f(x,y)=xy\\). Find the maximum value for \\(f\\) if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are constrained to sum to 1. Solve this problem two ways: by substitution and by using the Lagrangian method. By substitution Substitute \\(y = 1-x\\) into the objective function so that \\(f(x) = x(1-x) = x - x^2\\). Then maximize \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\). FOC: \\(1 - 2x = 0\\) \\(\\Rightarrow 1 = 2x\\) \\(\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} = x\\) Then \\(y = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(f(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}\\) By the Lagrangian Method \\[\\max_{x, y, \\lambda} xy + \\lambda[1-x-y]\\] FOCs: \\(f_1: y - \\lambda = 0\\) \\(f_2: x- \\lambda = 0\\) \\(\\lambda: 1 - x - y = 0\\) Using \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) by putting \\(\\lambda\\) on one side and taking the ratio of the first order conditions. \\(y = \\lambda\\) \\(x = \\lambda\\) \\(\\Rightarrow y = x\\) Now taking \\(y = x\\) and putting it into the FOC for \\(\\lambda\\) we get \\(1 - x - x = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} = y\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2} = x\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2} = \\lambda\\) Finally, \\(f(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}\\) 2.4 The dual problem to the one described in Problem 2.3 is \\[\\textbf{minimize } x + y\\] \\[\\textbf{subject to } xy = 0.25\\] Solve this problem using the Lagrangian technique. Then compare the value you get for the Lagrangian multiplier to the value you got in 2.3. Explain the relationship between the two solutions. \\[\\min_{x, y, \\lambda} x+y + \\lambda[0.25 - xy]\\] FOC: \\(f_1: 1 - \\lambda y = 0\\) \\(f_2: 1 - \\lambda x = 0\\) \\(f_{\\lambda}: 0.25 - xy = 0\\) Combine the first two equations as follows. \\(1 = \\lambda y\\) \\(1 = \\lambda x\\) Take the ratio of the left hand side and the ratio of the right hand side and obtain \\(1 = \\frac{y}{x}\\) or \\(x = y\\). Then take this and substitute into the FOC of \\(\\lambda\\). \\(0.25 = x^2\\) \\(\\Rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) Then, since \\(x = y\\), \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and taking both these results and plugging into the \\(f_1\\) FOC we find that \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Comparing this solution with the solution from 2.3 we find that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same. However, \\(\\lambda\\) of the problem in 2.4 is \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{2.3}}\\). The intuition of this is that \\(\\lambda\\), often referred to as the shadow value, can be understood as \\[\\lambda = \\frac{\\text{Marginal Benefit }x_i}{\\text{Marginal Cost }x_i}\\] for all \\(i\\). For the when two problems are ‘dual’ the marginal benefit in one becomes the marginal cost in the other. 2.5 The height of a ball that is thrown straight up with a certain force is a function of the time (t) from which it is released given by \\(f(t) = -0.5gt^2 + 40t\\) (Where \\(g\\) is a constant determined by gravity). How does the value of \\(t\\) at which the height of the ball is at a maximum depend on the parameter \\(g\\)? When we maximize \\(f\\) with respect to \\(t\\), we will find that it is a function of \\(g\\). \\(\\frac{df}{dt} = -gt + 40 = 0\\) \\(t^*(g) = \\frac{40}{g}\\) Use your answer to part (a) to describe how the maximum height changes as the parameter \\(g\\) changes. Plug optimal \\(t\\) into \\(f(.)\\). \\(f(g) = -\\frac{1}{2}g\\frac{40}{g}^2 + 40\\frac{40}{g} = \\frac{800}{g}\\). How does the max change as \\(g\\) changes? Take the derivative. \\(f&#39;(g) = -\\frac{800}{g^2}\\). By the envelope theorem, when we differentiate the value function \\(f(t^*(g),g)\\) with respect to \\(g\\), we will only get a non-zero contribution where the \\(g\\) directly enters the function. All contributions that come indirectly through \\(t^*(g)\\) are zero. \\[f(t^*(g), g) = -0.5g(t^*(g))^2 + 40(t^*(g))\\] So, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial f(t^*(g), g)}{\\partial g} &amp;= -0.5(t^*(g))^2 \\\\ &amp;= -0.5\\left(\\frac{40}{g}\\right)^2 \\\\ &amp;= -\\frac{800}{g^2} \\end{align*}\\] The same as in part b. Using the function in levels \\(f(32.1) - f(32) = \\frac{800}{32.1} - \\frac{800}{32} = -0.078\\). However, we can also calculate it with the derivative. We found \\(f&#39;(g) = -\\frac{800}{g^2}\\) so \\(f&#39;(32)=-0.78\\). and this is understood to be the per unit change in f as g changes. In this case we are not changing g by 1 we are changing g by 0.1. If we scale the derivative in this way, we get roughly the same answer. \\(0.1*f&#39;(32)=-0.78*0.1 = -0.078\\). 2.6 A simple way to model the construction of an oil tanker is to start with a large rectangular sheet of steel that is x feet wide and 3x feet long. Now cut a smaller square that is \\(t\\) feet on a side out of each corner of the larger sheet and fold up and weld the sides of the steel sheet to make a tray like structure with no top. [Figure Here] show that the volume of oil that can be held by this tray is given by: \\(V = t(x - 2t)(3x - 2t) = 3tx^2 - 8t^2x + 4t^3\\). Since volume is height X width X length, we calculate each of these and multiply. Length: \\(3x - 2t\\) Width: \\(x - 2t\\) height: \\(t\\) So, \\(v = t(x - 2t)(3x - 2t) = 3tx^2 - 8t^2x + 4t^3\\) How should t be chosen so as to maximize \\(V\\) for any given value of x? \\[\\max_{t} 3tx^2 - 8t^2x + 4t^3\\] FOC: \\(3x^2 - 16tx + 12t^2 = 0\\) Solve with the quadratic formula for t. \\(t = \\frac{16x \\pm \\sqrt{(-16x)^2 - 4*12*3*x^2}}{2*12}\\) \\(t = x(\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{7}}{6})\\) No, there is not a value of x that maximizes volume. If you increase x, volume will increase as well. Now that steel is constrained so that \\(1,000,000 = 3x^2 - 4t^2\\), we still know that \\(t\\) and \\(x\\) have to be related according to the solution in b, but the \\(t\\) and \\(x\\) are now bound to the constraint. We can visualize the solution as a guide. The constraint is an ellipse, and only the portions with positive \\(t\\) and \\(x\\) are relevant to this problem. [Figure Here] So, if we plug the expression for \\(t\\) that we found in b. into the constraint, we can solve. Note that since both \\(4 \\pm \\sqrt{y}\\) are positive we will get two solutions here. \\[1,000,000 = 3x^2 - 4\\left[x\\left(\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{7}}{6}\\right)\\right]^2\\] \\[1,000,000 = x^2\\left[ 3 - 4\\left(\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{7}}{6} \\right)\\right]\\] \\[\\Rightarrow x = 724.08\\] and plugging this into the relationship from b. \\[t = 801.92\\] or… \\[\\Rightarrow x = 598.02\\] and plugging this into the relationship from b. \\[t = 134.98\\] when using the - of the \\(\\pm\\). However, if you plug the first into the formula for \\(V\\), you get a negative number; that must be a local minimum. So, the solution to the constrained problem is \\(x = 598.02\\) and \\(t = 134.98\\). 2.7 Consider the following constrained maximization problem: \\[\\textbf{maximize } y = x_1 + 5\\ln{x_2}\\] \\[\\textbf{subject to } k - x_1 - x_2 = 0\\] where \\(k\\) is a constant. Show that if \\(k = 10\\) this problem can be solved as one involving only equality constraints. \\(k = 10 \\Rightarrow\\) \\[\\max x_1 + 5\\ln{10-x_1}\\] by setting \\(x_2 = 10 - x_1\\). FOC: \\(1 - \\frac{5}{10 - x_1} = 0\\) \\(\\Rightarrow x_1 = 5\\) and \\(x_2 = 10\\) If \\(k = 4\\) then the FOC becomes \\(1 - \\frac{5}{4 - x_1} = 0\\) and this solves to \\(x_1 = -1\\) and \\(x_2 = 5\\). If the \\(x&#39;s\\) must be non-negative, then \\(x_1 = 0\\) and the constraint defines the \\(x_2\\). In this case, \\(x_2 = 4\\). If \\(k = 20\\) then the FOC becomes \\(1 - \\frac{5}{20 - x_1} = 0\\) and the solution is \\(x_1 = 15\\) and \\(x_2 = 5\\). 2.8 Suppose a firm has a marginal cost function given by \\(MC(q) = q+1\\). What is the firm’s total cost function,? Explain why total costs are known only up to a constant of integration, which represents fixed costs. You find total cost by integrating the marginal cost, but of course, you can only recover this up to an unknown constant. Since the portion of the total cost function that is constant is the fixed cost - by definition - this is the fixed cost. \\[\\int q + 1 dq\\] Firms produce where price, \\(p\\), equals \\(MC(q)\\). How much will the firm produce when \\(p = 15\\)? Now assume that the firm just breaks even. What are the fixed costs, \\(FC\\)? \\(15 = q + 1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow q = 14\\). If just breaking even, then \\(15*14 - (0.5q^2 + q + FC) = 0\\) \\(\\Rightarrow FC = 98\\) How much will profits for this firm increase if price increases to $20? First, \\(20 = q + 1\\) so \\(q = 19\\). Then profits are given by \\(20*19 - (0.5*19^2 + 19 +98) = 82.50\\). Show that if we continue to assume profit maximization, then this firm’s profit can be expressed solely as a function of the price it receives. Then we may as well substitute \\(q = P - 1\\) from the \\(P = MC(q)\\) condition. Then we have \\(\\pi(P) = P(P-1) - (0.5(P-1)^2 + (P-1) + 98)\\) Show that the increase in profits from \\(P=15\\) to \\(P=20\\) can be calculated in two ways: (i) directly from the equation derived in part d; and by integrating the inverse marginal cost function \\(\\left[ MC^{-1}(P) = P-1\\right]\\). (i). Clearly \\(\\pi(20) - \\pi(15) = \\$82.50\\) yields the change in profit. (ii). \\(\\int_{15}^{20} P-1dP = (0.5P^2 - P)\\vert_{15}^{20} = \\$82.50\\) "],
["chapter-3-solutions.html", "Chapter 3 Solutions", " Chapter 3 Solutions 3.1 \\(U(x,y) = 3x+y\\) \\[\\begin{align*} U_1 &amp; = 3x+y \\\\ y &amp; = U_1 - 3x \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Then using \\(MRS = - \\left. \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\right|_{U = constant}\\) and we have \\(MRS = -(-3) = 3\\), which is a constant and not decreasing. \\(U(x,y) = \\sqrt{xy}\\) Since utility is un affected by a monotonic increasing transformation, we can square it and evaluate \\(U(x,y) = xy\\) instead since the math will be a little easier. \\[\\begin{align*} U_1 &amp; = xy \\\\ y &amp; = \\frac{U_1}{x} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Then the \\(MRS = -\\frac{-U_1}{x^2} = \\frac{U_1}{x^2}\\). Since \\(MRS\\) clearly decreases as \\(x\\) increases, the indifference curves are convex. \\(U(x,y) = \\sqrt{x} + y\\) then \\(y = U_1 - \\sqrt{x}\\) and the \\(MRS = -(-\\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}\\). Clearly this \\(MRS\\) decreases with \\(x\\) so yes these indifference curves are convex. \\(U(x,y) = \\sqrt{x^2 - y^2}\\) Then, \\[\\begin{align*} U_1 &amp; = \\sqrt{x^2 - y^2}\\\\ U^2_1 &amp; = x^2 - y^2 \\\\ y^2 &amp; = x^2 - U^2_1 \\\\ y &amp; = \\sqrt{x^2 - U^2_1} \\end{align*}\\] And then finding the \\(MRS\\), \\[\\begin{align*} MRS &amp; = - \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{(x^2 - U^2_1)}} \\end{align*}\\] Yes, these indifference curves decrease as x increases, but this is a tricky question because this is not a proper utility curve to begin with. \\(U(x,y) = \\frac{xy}{x+y}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} U_0 &amp;= \\frac{xy}{x+y} \\\\ U_0(x+y) &amp;= xy \\\\ U_0x &amp;= xy - U_0y \\\\ U_0x &amp;= y(x-U_0) \\\\ y &amp;= \\frac{U_0x}{x-U_0} \\end{align*}\\] So, \\[\\begin{align*} MRS &amp;= -\\frac{dy}{dx}\\biggr\\rvert_{U=U_0} \\\\ &amp;= -\\left( \\frac{U_0(x-U_0) - U_0x}{(x-U_0)^2} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{U_0^2}{(x-U_0)^2} \\end{align*}\\] Is the MRS everywhere decreasing? \\[\\frac{\\partial MRS}{\\partial x} = -2U_0(x-U_0)^{-3} &lt; 0\\] for all \\(x&gt;0\\). So yes, the function is quasi-concave. To check out these and other indifference curves see desmos.com/calculator a-e indifference curves 3.3 \\(U(x,y) = xy\\) From above, \\(MRS = \\frac{U_1}{x^2}\\) and we verified it was decreasing MRS. Marginal Utilities: \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = y\\] which is constant with respect to \\(x\\). \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = x\\] which is constant with respect to \\(y\\). \\(U(x,y) = x^2y^2\\) Similarly, \\(MRS = \\frac{\\sqrt{U_1}}{x^2}\\), which we showed was decreasing. Marginal Utilities: \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = 2xy^2\\] which is increasing in x. \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = 2x^2y\\] which is increasing with respect to \\(y\\). \\(U(x,y) = ln(x) + ln(y)\\) Show that \\(y = \\frac{e^{U_1}}{x}\\) is the equation for a general indifference curve and \\(MRS = \\frac{e^{U_1}}{x^2}\\), and show that it is decreasing. Marginal Utilities: \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{x}\\] and \\[\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{y}\\] both marginal utilities are increasing. What can we conclude from this?? We can conclude that decreasing marginal utility is not necessary to get diminishing \\(MRS\\) and quasi-concavity. The book makes a bid deal out of this, because, in the U.S. it is common to teach the intuition for decreasing \\(MRS\\) by starting with decreasing marginal utility. And it makes a very good intuitive explanation of how utility math functions can be related to actual human behavior, but mathematically, it is not technically required to have decreasing marginal utility to get decreasing \\(MRS\\). 3.5 perfect compliments 1 hot dog perfectly fixed with condiments \\(1 + 0.25 + 0.05 + 0.30 = \\$1.60\\) \\(cost = \\$2.10\\) a percent increase of \\(31\\%\\) \\(cost = \\$1.725\\) lower percent increase (\\(7.8\\%\\)) because the bun is a smaller component of the overall cost. Spread the tax so there is no waste of utility. A hot dog with all the condiments only needs to cost \\(\\$2.60\\) a \\(62.5\\%\\) increase. Thus increase the cost of each component by \\(62.5\\%\\). \\[1.625(1*\\$1 + 0.5*\\$0.50 + 1*\\$0.05 + 2*\\$0.15) = \\$2.60\\] 3.7 At point \\((6,5)\\) the \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{3}\\) and at point \\((12,3)\\) the \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{3}\\) This can only happen with a linear indifference curve. Find the equation by finding the line through the two points. Using the point-slope form of a line from algebra, we find the indifference curve through \\((6,5)\\) can be expressed as: \\[7 = y + \\frac{1}{3}x\\] Then, 7 takes the place of our utility level we usually call \\(U_1\\), and we can write the general utility function as: \\[U(x,y) = y + \\frac{1}{3}x\\] The problem description implies that \\(MRS = \\frac{1}{4}\\). Further, we know the \\(MRS\\) of a Cobb-Douglass utility function is given by: \\[MRS = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\frac{y}{x}\\] Then, by plugging in the \\(MRS\\) value and the point, we can recover \\(\\alpha\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{4} &amp; = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\alpha &amp; = (1-\\alpha)2 \\\\ \\alpha &amp; = \\frac{2}{3} \\\\ 1-\\alpha &amp; = \\frac{1}{3} \\end{align*}\\] and so now we know the full utility function. 3.10 Does not depend on \\(\\alpha + \\beta = 1\\). To see this, suppose \\(\\alpha + \\beta \\neq 1\\). Then since preferences are indifferent to a monotonic transformation, substitute \\(\\alpha = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}\\) now \\(\\alpha + \\beta = 1\\) (go ahead and check it!). If \\(y=x\\) then \\(MRS=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\) so if \\(\\alpha&gt;\\beta\\) then \\(MRS&gt;1\\). Intuition: The relative size of \\(\\alpha\\) to \\(\\beta\\) says the extent to which you prefer \\(x\\) to \\(y\\). \\(MRS = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\frac{(y-_0)}{(x-x_0)}\\). Not homothetic since you can’t express as ratio of \\(x\\) to \\(y\\). 3.13 \\(MRS = \\left. \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{y}} \\right|_{U = constant} = y\\) or using another method, set \\(y=e^{-x+U_1}\\), where \\(U_1\\) is an arbitrary constant. Then, \\(MRS = -[-e^{-x +U_1}]=e^{-x+U_1} = y\\). With this utility function depends only on the level of \\(y\\), whereas usually the bundle containing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) contributes to the MRS. Sometimes \\(x\\) is called the numeraire good, the economic entity that serves as the standard by which value is computed in an economy. All other goods’ value can be expressed in terms of how much of the numeraire it required to trade for the good. Intuitive examples are gold or fiat money, but any economy that has a good that functions like currency functions like a numeraire. Wikipedia article - Quasilinear Utility This figure uses the desmos.com calculator to show several indifference curves setting \\(U_1 = 1, 2, \\text{ and } 3\\) respectively. Now adding tangent lines to each indifference curve when \\(y=1\\). The tangent lines when \\(y=1\\) are clearly parallel, so the MRS is constant when \\(y=1\\). This illustrates that the MRS depends only on y and not on the x value. Imagine now that the tangent lines are budget lines, then you can see that as income increases, only the consumption of x increases. The consumption of good y is not subject to a wealth effect. All income effects are captured by the numeraire, x. Note from a that the MRS is decreasing in \\(x\\) (y is after all a function of x…), so the function is quasi-concave. \\(y=e^{-x+U_1}\\), where \\(U_1\\) is an arbitrary constant. \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = 1\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{y}\\) Notice that the marginal utility of \\(x\\) is constant, so as you buy more, the marginal utility of x is not diminishing. The question here is trying to lead you toward discovering the concept of a numeraire good. Desmos Graphin Calculator Demo "],
["chapter-4-solutions.html", "Chapter 4 Solutions", " Chapter 4 Solutions 4.1 The utility function, \\(U(t,s)=\\sqrt{ts}\\), is really just Cobb-Douglass utility with \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\) and \\(\\beta = 0.5\\), so using the solution we derived in the notes, \\[t^* = \\frac{I}{2p_t} \\text{ and } s^* = \\frac{I}{2p_s}\\]. Substituting in for \\(I= 1, p_t = 0.10,\\) and \\(p_s = 0.25\\), we find the solution, \\(t^* = 5,\\) and \\(s^* = 2\\). Indirect utility is useful here. \\[V(p_t, p_s, I) = \\frac{I}{2p_t^{0.5}p_s^{0.5}}\\] Increase income by \\(k\\) to achieve same utility level. To find, we solve for \\(k\\) in the following equation, \\[V(0.40, 0.25, 1+k) = V(0.10, 0.25, 1)\\], or in plain English, solve for \\(k\\) such that the utility achieved under the new prices and additional income is the same as the utility achieved with the old prices and income. Solve: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1+k}{2*0.40^{0.5}*0.25^{0.5}} &amp;= \\frac{1}{2*0.10^{0.5}*0.25^{0.5}} \\\\ k &amp;= \\frac{0.40^{0.5}*0.25^{0.5}}{0.10^{0.5}*0.25^{0.5}} - 1 \\\\ k &amp;= $1 \\end{align*}\\] His mother should send $2, a $1 increase. 4.2 \\(w_F^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{I}{p_F}\\), and \\(w_C^* = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{I}{p_C}\\) Substitute in the parameters given in the problem. \\[\\begin{align*} w_F^* &amp;= \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{600}{40} \\\\ &amp;= 10 \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} w_C^* &amp;= \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{600}{8} \\\\ &amp;= 25 \\end{align*}\\] California wine purchased stays the same, but now French wine purchased is, \\[\\begin{align*} w_F^* &amp;= \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{600}{20} \\\\ &amp;= 20 \\end{align*}\\] Because the French wine is now cheaper she can buy more for the same income and achieve higher utility. To put a monetary value on it, check how much she would be willing to reduce her income in order to face the new (lower) prices. \\[V(20, 8, 600-k) = V(40, 8, 600)\\], she is willing to reduce income by as much as \\(k\\) to get the new lower price. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\frac{600-k}{20^{\\frac{2}{3}}8^{\\frac{1}{3}}} &amp;= \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\frac{600}{40^{\\frac{2}{3}}8^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\end{align*}\\] solving for \\(k\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 600 - k &amp;= \\frac{600*20^{\\frac{2}{3}}8^{\\frac{1}{3}}}{40^{\\frac{2}{3}}8^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\\\ k &amp;= 600 - \\frac{600}{2^{\\frac{2}{3}}} \\\\ k &amp;= 222.02 \\end{align*}\\] An alternative monetary measure would be to check how much she would be willing to accept (increase income) to keep the old prices.

We can use a Lagrangian function to solve the constrained optimization problem. \\[\\mathscr{L} = 20c - c^2 + 18b - b^2 + \\lambda[5-c-b]\\] The first order conditions of the Lagrangian problem are: \\[\\begin{align*} 20 - 2c - \\lambda &amp;= 0 \\\\ 18 - 6b - \\lambda &amp;= 0 \\\\ 5 -c -b &amp;= 0 \\end{align*}\\] solving for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) gives \\(b = 1\\) and \\(c = 4\\). 4.4 Maximising \\(U(x+y)= x^2+y^2\\) won’t alter the results because MRS is unchanged under a monotonit increasing transformation. \\[\\mathscr{L} = x^2 + y^2 +\\lambda[50-3x-4y]\\] The first order conditions of the Lagrangian problem are: \\[\\begin{align*} 2x - 3\\lambda &amp;= 0 \\\\ 2y - 4\\lambda &amp;= 0 \\\\ 50 - 3x - 4y &amp; = 0 \\end{align*}\\] Combining eqns 1 and 2, \\(\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{3}{4}\\).

Since the indifference curves are not convex, the solution to the problem is actually a local minimum, not a local maximum! 4.7. This graph is in our lecture notes. The expenditure required to achieve utility of 2. \\[\\begin{align*} e(p_x, p_y, U) &amp;= 2p_x^{\\frac{1}{2}}p_y^{\\frac{1}{2}}U \\\\ &amp;= 2*1^{\\frac{1}{2}}*4^{\\frac{1}{2}}2 \\text{ using example 4.4 prices}\\\\ &amp;= \\$8 \\end{align*}\\] The expenditure required to achieve utility of 3. \\[\\begin{align*} e(p_x, p_y, U) &amp;= 2p_x^{\\frac{1}{2}}p_y^{\\frac{1}{2}}U \\\\ e(1, 4, 2) &amp;= 2*1^{\\frac{1}{2}}*4^{\\frac{1}{2}}2 \\text{ using example 4.4 prices}\\\\ &amp;= \\$8 \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} e(1, 4, 3) &amp;= 2*1^{\\frac{1}{2}}*4^{\\frac{1}{2}}3 \\text{ using example 4.4 prices}\\\\ &amp;= \\$12 \\end{align*}\\] So it is $4 extra (\\(\\$4 = \\$12 - \\$8\\)) Assuming the same expenditureof $8, how much would we have to subsidise \\(x\\) to achieve utility of 3? Solve the following: \\[\\begin{align*} 8 &amp;= e(1 - s,4, 3) \\\\ 8 &amp;= 2(1-s)^{\\frac{1}{2}}4^{\\frac{1}{2}}3 \\end{align*}\\] Solving yields \\(s = \\$\\frac{5}{9}\\). To calculate the cost to the government, multiply by the quantity of x purchased. \\[\\frac{5}{9}x^* = \\frac{5}{9}\\frac{8}{2(1-\\frac{5}{9})} = \\$5\\] If the objective is to raise utility from 2 to 3, it is cheaper for the government to give an income grant of $4 than to subsidise the purchase of \\(x\\), because that would cost $5. This is the lump sum principle. The general expediture function for Cobb-Douglas utility is given by \\(e(p_x, p_y, U) = \\frac{p_x^{\\frac{1}{2}}p_y^{\\frac{1}{2}}U}{\\alpha^{\\alpha} \\beta^{\\beta}}\\), and for \\(\\alpha = 0.3\\), the quantity \\(\\alpha^{\\alpha} \\beta^{\\beta} \\approx 0.543\\). So, achieving utility of 2 requires \\[e(1, 4, 2) = \\frac{1^{0.3}*4^{0.7}2}{0.543} = 9.774\\] while achieving utility of 3 requires \\[e(1, 4, 2) = \\frac{1^{0.3}*4^{0.7}3}{0.543} = 14.66\\] which is $4.89 extra. Because there are no substitution effects in the fixed proportion case, the optimal point would be the same and also the cost to govt would be same. 4.10 The solution to a utility max problem with \\(U(x,y) = x^{\\alpha}y^{1-\\alpha}\\) is \\[x^* = \\alpha\\frac{I}{p_x} \\text{ and } y^* = \\beta\\frac{I}{p_y}\\] Then indirect utility is \\[\\begin{align*} V(p_x,p_y, I) &amp;= \\left[ \\alpha\\frac{I}{p_x} \\right]^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\beta\\frac{I}{p_y} \\right]^{\\beta} \\\\ &amp;= \\alpha^{\\alpha}(1-\\alpha)^{\\alpha}\\frac{I}{p_x^{\\alpha}*p_y^{\\beta}} \\end{align*}\\] Since the indirect utility function is right in front of us, we can use duality to derive the expenditure function from the indirect utility function. Since income is equal to expenditure, we replace \\(I\\) with \\(e(p_x,p_y,\\overline U)\\), and replace \\(V(p_x,p_y, I)\\) with \\(\\overline U\\). \\[\\overline U = \\alpha^{\\alpha}(1-\\alpha)^{\\alpha}\\frac{e(p_x,p_y,\\overline U)}{p_x^{\\alpha}*p_y^{1- \\alpha}} \\] Now, solving for \\(e(p_x,p_y, U)\\) \\[e(p_x,p_y, U) = \\frac{p_x^{\\alpha}*p_y^{1- \\alpha}* \\overline U}{\\alpha^{\\alpha}(1-\\alpha)^{\\alpha}} \\] The compensation required to offset the effect of a price rise of \\(x\\) can be expressed as \\[\\begin{align*} e(p_x^1,p_y, \\overline U) - e(p_x^0,p_y, \\overline U) = \\frac{\\left(p_x^1\\right)^{\\alpha}*p_y^{1- \\alpha}* \\overline U}{\\alpha^{\\alpha}(1-\\alpha)^{\\alpha}} - \\frac{\\left(p_x^0\\right)^{\\alpha}*p_y^{1- \\alpha}* \\overline U}{\\alpha^{\\alpha}(1-\\alpha)^{\\alpha}} \\end{align*}\\] This expression obviously varies with \\(\\alpha\\) and the higher the \\(\\alpha\\) the more compensation needed. One could attempt to differentiate this expression with respect to \\(\\alpha\\) but that would be a yucky derivative so we’ll skip it. "],

They do, however, show that both cross prices affect x &amp; y. 5.10 More on elasticities Part (e) of Problem 5.9 has a number of useful applications because it shows how price responses depend ultimately on the underlying parameters of the utility function.

George’s Utility = \\(ln(x)\\) Starting wealth = 1000000 If he wins he gets 1,000 , if he loses 1,000 . Therefore: \\(ln(1000000) = \\pi(bullswin) * ln(1100000) + (1-\\pi(bullswin))*ln(900000)\\) \\(ln(1000000)= ln(900000) + \\pi(bullswin)*(ln(1100000)-ln(900000))\\) \\(\\pi(bullswin) = (ln(1000000) - ln(900000))/ (ln(1100000) - ln(900000))\\) Computing we get that \\(\\pi(bullswin) = .525042\\) or 52.5%, meaning that George believes the bulls have, at least, a 52.5% chance of winning the NBA finals. 7.5. Ms. Fogg’s Utility = \\(ln(Y)\\) Prob of losing 1,000 = 25% or .25 Therefore \\(E[U(Y)] = .25*ln(9,000) + .75*ln(10,000)\\) \\(E[U(Y)] = 9.184\\) In order to prove to her that her utility would be greater after she purchase’s the insurance, all we need is to compare the utility’s with and without insurance. From a) we know that \\(E[U(Y)] = 9.184\\) So we calculate U(Y) with the fair actuarial rate of $250. \\(U(Y) = ln(10000-250) = 9.185\\) As \\(U(Y)&gt; E[U(Y)]\\) we can prove to her that it is better to buy insurance at this rate. Max insurance, form definition, is the difference between Initial Wealth and CE. As shown below: Figure 1. If we know Initial Wealth is 10,000, we only need to find CE. \\(U(CE) = E[U(gamble)]\\) \\(ln(CE) = 9.184\\) (from a) \\(CE = 9,740.04\\) Using Initial Wealth - CE = max premium, we get \\(Max Prem = 10,000 - 9,740.04\\) \\(Max Prem = 259.97\\) 7.7 A farmer believes there is a 50–50 chance that the next growing season will be abnormally rainy. His expected utility function has the form expected value = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\Upsilon_{NR} + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\Upsilon_{R}\\) where \\(\\Upsilon_{NR}\\) and \\(\\Upsilon_{NR}\\) represent the farmer’s income in the states of “normal rain” and “rainy,” respectively. Suppose the farmer must choose between two crops that promise the following income prospects: Crop \\(\\Upsilon_{NR}\\) \\(\\Upsilon_{R}\\) Wheat 28,000 10,000 Corn 19,000 15,000 Which of the crops will he plant? \\(EV(Wheat) = \\frac{1}{2}28,000 + \\frac{1}{2}10,000 = 19,000\\) \\(EV(Corn) = \\frac{1}{2}19,000 + \\frac{1}{2}15,000 = 17,000\\) \\(EU(Wheat) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln28,000 + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln10,000 = 9.725\\) \\(EU(Corn) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln19,000 + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln15,000 = 9.734\\) Here, the farmer produces both corn and wheat even though the expected value for wheat exceeds the expected value for corn. This is because the farmer’s utility of wealth is concave. In other words, this individual is risk averse and chooses to plant at least some corn because corn profits less susceptible to the risks posed by abnormally high levels of rain. Suppose the farmer can plant half his field with each crop. Would he choose to do so? Explain your result. \\(EU(\\frac{1}{2}Wheat,\\frac{1}{2}Corn) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln19000 + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln17,000 = 9.74912\\) Because the farmer’s expected utility for planting half of his field with wheat and half of his field with corn exceeds the expected utility of planting any one crop exclusively, he may consider this strategy as an option. However as we see in in the next step, the farmer maximizes his expected utility by planting these crops in a more optimal proportion. What mix of wheat and corn would provide maximum expected utility to this farmer? \\[\\begin{align*} EU(\\alpha, 1 - \\alpha) &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}\\ln[\\alpha28,000 + (1- \\alpha)19,000]+\\frac{1}{2}\\ln[\\alpha10,000 + (1- \\alpha)15,000] \\\\ EU(\\alpha, 1 - \\alpha) &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}\\ln[19,000 + 9,000\\alpha]+\\frac{1}{2}\\ln[15,000 - 5,000\\alpha] \\end{align*}\\] Then, to find optimal proportion, we take the partial derivative with respect to \\(\\alpha\\). \\[\\frac{\\partial EU}{\\partial \\alpha}= \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{9,000}{19,000 + 9,000\\alpha}+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{-5,000}{15,000 - 5,000\\alpha}=0\\] Solving the first order condition, we find \\(\\alpha = .4\\overline{4}\\) and \\((1-\\alpha) = .5\\overline{5}\\). In these proportions, the farmer’s expected utility is: \\[\\begin{align*} EU &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}\\ln[(.4\\overline{4})28,000 + (.5\\overline{5})19,000]+\\frac{1}{2}\\ln[(.4\\overline{4})10,000 + (.5\\overline{5})15,000] \\\\ EU &amp;= 9.74935 \\end{align*}\\] So, if the farmer wishes to optimize his expected utilility he should devote approximately 44% of his field to wheat production and 56% to corn production.

The production function for new bar stools is given by, \\[q=0.1k^{0.2}t^{0.8}\\] where q is the number of bar stools produced during the renovation week, k represents the number of hours of bar stool lathes used during the week, and l represents the number of worker hours employed during the period. Sam would like to provide 10 new bar stools, and he has allocated a budget of \\(10,000\\) for the project Sam reasons that because bar stool lathes and skilled bar stool workers both cost the same amount (\\(50\\) per hours), he might as well hire these two inputs in equal amounts.

["chapter-10-solutions.html", "Chapter 10 Solutions", " Chapter 10 Solutions Contributed by Noé Nava and Brant Bruxvoort 2017 The following function exhibits economies of scope: \\[C(q_1,0)+C(0,q_2)&gt;C(q_1,q_2)\\] 10.2 The above inequality exhibits a production function of a firm producing two different goods at a lower cost than two firms producing each good separately. This inequality captures the concept of efficiency: Even though two firms could produce each good separately at the lowest cost of production possible for them, the multi-product firm is able to achieve lower costs than them at the same level of efficiency. We know that the average costs fall as quantity increases, and that the average cost of a firm producing one good is greater than the average cost of a multi-product firm producing the same good. The expressions below capture this, \\[\\frac{C(q_1)}{q_1}&gt;\\frac{C(q_1+q_2)}{q_1+q_2}\\] and \\[\\frac{C(q_2)}{q_2}&gt;\\frac{C(q_1+q_2)}{q_1+q_2}\\] If we multiply each inequality by \\(q_1\\)and \\(q_2\\), respectively, we obtain, \\[q_1(\\frac{C(q_1)}{q_1})&gt;q_1(\\frac{C(q_1+q_2)}{q_1+q_2})\\] and \\[q_2(\\frac{C(q_2)}{q_2})&gt;q_2(\\frac{C(q_1+q_2)}{q_1+q_2})\\] Next, we combine both inequalities adding the left hand side terms and the right left hand side, maintaining the sign as follows, \\[q_1(\\frac{C(q_1)}{q_1})+q_2(\\frac{C(q_2)}{q_2})&gt;q_1(\\frac{C(q_1+q_2)}{q_1+q_2})+q_2(\\frac{C(q_1+q_2)}{q_1+q_2})\\] Notice that we can re-write the above expression to get, \\[q_1(\\frac{C(q_1)}{q_1})+q_2(\\frac{C(q_2)}{q_2})&gt;(q_1+q_2)(\\frac{C(q_1+q_2)}{q_1+q_2})\\] Finally, we can simplify the expression as follows, \\[C(q_1)+C(q_2)&gt;C(q_1+q_2)\\] Therefore, we know that this multi-product firm enjoys economies of scope. 10.3 The following equation represents the production function of Professor Smith and Professor Jones: \\[q=S^.5*J^.5\\] a) To obtain the number of hours that Professor Jones needs to spend to produce a finish book of \\(q\\) number of pages, we have to solve the above equality for \\(J\\). \\[q=S^.5*J^.5\\] \\[\\frac{q}{S^.5}=J^.5\\] \\[J=\\frac{q^2}{S}\\] Next, we plug in the value for \\(S\\) \\[J=\\frac{q^2}{900}\\] Finally, we plug in the values of \\(q\\) we want to analyze (\\(q\\) = 150, 300 and 450): \\[J=\\frac{150^2}{900}=25\\] \\[J=\\frac{300^2}{900}=100\\] \\[J=\\frac{450^2}{900}=225\\] To obtain the cost of production, we will sum the cost for Professor Smith’s time with the cost of Professor Jone’s time as follows, \\[C(q)=3*(900)+\\frac{12}{900}q^2\\] The first term is the cost of Professor Smith’s time, and the second term is the cost of Professor Jone’s time. Next, we calculate the Marginal Cost, \\[MC(q)=\\frac{24}{900}q\\] Finally, we plug in the values of \\(q\\) we want to analyze (\\(q\\) = 150, 300 and 450): \\[MC(q)=\\frac{24}{900}*150=4\\] \\[MC(q)=\\frac{24}{900}*300=8\\] \\[MC(q)=\\frac{24}{900}*450=12\\] 10.4 The firm’s fixed proportion production function is given by, \\[q=min(5k,10l)\\] a) First, notice that a firm experiencing a proportion production finds efficiency whenever it produces at a certain rate of inputs given by, \\[5k=10l\\] The above ratio means that the firm produces efficiently whenever it uses twice as much productive capital as labor; you can solve by \\(k\\) and \\(l\\) to verify. Next, we calculate the quantity the firm produces at the level of efficiency, \\[q*=5k\\] and \\[q*=10l\\] Where \\(q*\\) denotes quantity at the level of efficiency. Since we are analyzing the amount of inputs, we solve the above two equalities by \\(k\\) and \\(l\\) to get, \\[k*=\\frac{q}{5}\\] and \\[l*=\\frac{q}{10}\\] Where \\(k*\\) and \\(l*\\) denote productive capital and labor at the level of efficiency. Next, we calculate the firm’s long run Total Cost, \\(LTC\\), Average Cost, \\(LAC\\) and Marginal Cost, \\(LMC\\). The form of this firm’s \\(LTC\\) operating at the level of efficiency is: \\[LTC=vk*+wl*\\] Where \\(v\\) is the cost for each unit of productive capital, \\(k\\), and \\(w\\) is the wage of each unit of labor, \\(l\\). Finally, we plug in the values for \\(k*\\) and \\(l*\\), and calculate \\(LAC\\) and \\(LMC\\): \\[LTC=v\\frac{q}{5}+w\\frac{q}{10}\\] \\[LAC=\\frac{v}{5}+\\frac{w}{10}\\] \\[LMC=\\frac{v}{5}+\\frac{w}{10}\\] b) We know that in the short run \\(k\\) must be constant since the firm cannot liquidate or buy more productive capital. Using part a information, we know that if \\(k=10\\), the firm will produce \\(q=50\\), and \\(l=5\\). Notice that these inputs will guarantee efficiency. Finally, the firm’s short run Total Cost, \\(STC\\), Average Cost, \\(SAC\\) and \\(SMC\\) are given by, \\[STC=10v+w\\frac{q}{10}\\] \\[SAC=10\\frac{v}{q}+\\frac{w}{10}\\] \\[SMC=\\frac{w}{10}\\] c) If \\(v=1\\) and \\(w=3\\) the firm’s long run Total Cost, \\(LTC\\), Average Cost, \\(LAC\\) and Marginal Cost, \\(LMC\\).

A lump sum subsidy does not affect the monopolist’s decision at the margin. More specifically, the lump sum subsidy doesn’t enter the first order condition, and therefore does not affect the firm’s optimal choice: \\[\\begin{align} \\pi_{LS} &amp; = P(Q)Q - C(Q) + S \\rightarrow S = lump sum subsidy \\end{align}\\] FOC: \\[\\begin{align} P(Q) + P&#39;(Q)Q - C&#39;(Q) = 0 \\rightarrow No S appears \\end{align}\\] A per unit subsidy lowers the marginal cost of producing each unit. Insert graph here. So, net total social gain is the same under competition and the subsidized monopoly (although it involves a transfer from taxpayers to the monopolist).
