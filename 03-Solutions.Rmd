# Chapter 3 Solutions {-}

3.1  

a.  

$U(x,y) = 3x+y$

\begin{align*}
U_1 & = 3x+y \\
 y & = U_1 - 3x \\
\end{align*}

Then using $MRS = - \left. \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right|_{U = constant}$

and we have $MRS = -(-3) = 3$, which is a constant and not decreasing. 

b.  

$U(x,y) = \sqrt{xy}$  

Since utility is un affected by a monotonic increasing transformation, we can square it and evaluate $U(x,y) = xy$ instead since the math will be a little easier.   


\begin{align*}
U_1 & = xy \\
 y & = \frac{U_1}{x} \\
\end{align*}

Then the $MRS = -\frac{-U_1}{x^2} = \frac{U_1}{x^2}$.

Since $MRS$ clearly decreases as $x$ increases, the indifference curves are convex. 

c.  

$U(x,y) = \sqrt{x} + y$  

then $y = U_1 - \sqrt{x}$ and the $MRS = -(-\frac{1}{2}x^{-\frac{1}{2}}) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$.

Clearly this $MRS$ decreases with $x$ so yes these indifference curves are convex. 

d.   

$U(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 - y^2}$  

Then, 

\begin{align*}
U_1 & = \sqrt{x^2 - y^2}\\
U^2_1 & = x^2 - y^2 \\
y^2 & = x^2 - U^2_1 \\
y & = \sqrt{x^2 - U^2_1}
\end{align*}


And then finding the $MRS$,  

\begin{align*}
MRS & = -( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(x^2 - U^2_1)}}2x)
\end{align*}

Yes, these indifference curves decrease as x increases, but this is a tricky question because this is not a proper utility curve to begin with.
